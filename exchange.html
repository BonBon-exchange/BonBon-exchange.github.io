            <div class="paragraph-light paragraph-list">
                <p>Like any regular exchange, trade making Bids and Asks. But on this exchange, you are bidding for data
                    with granular properties. Do you want browsing histories, browsing themes, retentions, returning
                    frequencies, usages time or other tabs/windows url? Do you want to obtain data from all users, a
                    specific city, women, or the 90s generation? Everything is possible, except users fingerprinting,
                    porn/adult related requests and requests leading to a very small population.</p>

                            <p>A practical example: A company wants to understand the needs and habits of Github users,
                                in order to propose a tailored service to this market audience.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bid: CHF 5.- per unit | other tabs (urls) opened when visiting github.com | 1000
                                    units (users) maximum over 30 days of usage | living in Europe</li>
                                <li>Ask: CHF 5.- | urls visited and urls association (tabs opened at the same time)
                                    those last 30 days | living in Europe</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Another example: A startup proposes a new online service. A potential competitor wants to
                                replicate the service, but also wants to ensure that the user retention is good enough
                                to justify the investment.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bid: CHF 5.- per unit | if you visited startupweb.com, did you come back to the
                                    website and when | 1000 units (users) maximum over 30 days of usage | living
                                    anywhere</li>
                                <li>Ask: CHF 5.- | visited startupweb.com, visited a second time or not | living in US
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>One more: A company wants to sell bags for women.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bid: CHF 25.- per unit | bags websites visited | 100 units (users) maximum over 30
                                    days of usage | living in Geneva</li>
                                <li>Ask: CHF 10.- | browsing history of the last 30 days | living in Geneva</li>
