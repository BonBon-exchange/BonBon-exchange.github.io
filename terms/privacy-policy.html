            <h4>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-light">We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal
                Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage
                data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types,
                preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of
                clicks. Personal Information includes your email, ip address, and browsing data, which you submit to us
                through the registration process at the Site.
            </p>
            <h6><em>1. Information collected via Technology
                </em></h6>
            <p class="paragraph-light">To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information. To
                use the Service thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. However, in an
                effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by
                our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as
                the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service,
                the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. In our
                browser, we do not have any data collection systems in place at the moment. We may add some in future
                updates, but they will be turned off by default and any collected data will belong to the user.
            </p>
            <h6><em>2. Information you provide us by registering for an account
                </em></h6>
            <p class="paragraph-light">In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you
                visit the Site, to become a subscriber to the Service you will need to create a personal profile. You
                can create a profile by registering with the Service and entering your email address, and creating a
                user name and a password. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your email
                address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h6><em>3. Children’s Privacy
                </em></h6>
            <p class="paragraph-light">The Site and the Service are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. The Site
                does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13, or allow anyone under
                the age of 13 to sign up for the Service. In the event that we learn that we have gathered personal
                information from anyone under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian, we will delete
                that information as soon as possible. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact
                us through <a href="/contact" class="link">our contact page</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</h4>
            <h6><em>Personal Information:</em></h6>
            <p class="paragraph-light">Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or
                otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your
                consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Company, such
                as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes
                of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in
                accordance with our Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-light">In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us
                communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to
                questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support, and inform users about promotional
                offers.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-light">We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith
                belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet
                any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of
                Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns;
                or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or
                permitted by law.
            </p>
            <h6><em>Non-Personal Information:
                </em></h6>
            <p class="paragraph-light">In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and
                customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and
                analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of
                Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to
                our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-light">In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by
                another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the
                assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this
                Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as
                set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will
                post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest
                that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.
            </p>
            <h4>III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION
            </h4>
            <p class="paragraph-light">We implement security measures designed to protect your information from
                unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to
                keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account
                after each use. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing
                certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer
                technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed,
                disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our
                Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
            </p>
            <h4>IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
            </h4>
            <p class="paragraph-light">You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing
                purposes. When we send a promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further
                promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional
                e-mail. You can also indicate that you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us in the
                opt-out page of the Site. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by
                either unsubscribing or opting out in the opt-out page of the Site, we may continue to send you
                administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h4>V. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
            </h4>
            <p class="paragraph-light">As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other
                websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those
                websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information
                collected by us through the Site and the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your
                use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Site or via our Service. To the extent
                that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application, then the privacy policy
                of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We
                encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.
            </p>

                any time. We will notify you of significant changes to our Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the
                primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
